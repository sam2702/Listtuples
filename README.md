# Listtuples
# Tuples
# Task 
Given an integer,n , and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, , of those  integers. Then compute and print the result of hash(t).

Note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be imported.

# Input Format

The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the number of elements in the tuple. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the elements in tuple t.

# Output Format

Print the result of hash(t).


# Lists

 Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
 insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
 print: Print the list.
 remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
 append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
 sort: Sort the list.
 pop: Pop the last element from the list.
 reverse: Reverse the list.

 Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the types listed above.
 Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

# Input Format
 The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of commands. 
 Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains one of the commands described above.

# Constraints
 The elements added to the list must be integers.

# Output Format
 For each command of type print, print the list on a new line.
